# N-Body Simulation 


This repository is a log of my attempt to reproduce various flavors of [N-body simulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_simulation), written in `rust`. Ultimately I hope it will include the following:

- A brute force solver
- A [Barnes-Hut solver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnes%E2%80%93Hut_simulation)
- Animation and live graphics
- Some degree of interactivity
